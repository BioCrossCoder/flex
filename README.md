## Introduction

A Golang library to make development easier and more efficient

## Features

1. `itertools` provide a series of functions to create iterators.
2. `functools` provide a series of functions to support functional programming.
3. `collections` provide a series of powerful and practical containers to store and manipulate data.
4. `typed` provide `itertools`, `functools` and `collections` with `generics` support.
5. This library mainly refers to `Python` and `JavaScript`, considering the feature of `Golang` as well.

## ToDo List

1. Robustness: Add fuzz tests to ensure the robustness of the library.
2. Maintainability: Add annotations to the code to make it more readable; standardize the naming of the functions and variables to make it more consistent.
3. Functionality: Provide more practical functions in `functools` for manipulating `sequences` (`slice`/`array`/`string`).
4. Usability: Generate documentation for the library and provide examples for each function.
5. Compatibility: Support lower versions of `Golang` to ensure compatibility with older projects; split `typed` package.
